AI in Med Affairs AI Agent Creation Team Activity Slide Outline




Agent Creation Team Activity
________________


Slide 1 — Title & Framing (0–3 min)
From Prompts to Agents
 Designing Practical AI Workflows for Medical Affairs
* Build once → reuse often

* Less prompting. More leverage.

________________


Slide 2 — What You’ll Walk Out With (3–6 min)
By the end of this session, you will:
   * Know when to use a prompt vs an agent

   * Understand the building blocks of agents

   * Build at least 2 agents

   * Team activity: build your own agent + Shark Tank pitch to win all the glory

________________


Slide 3 — Agent in a Box: Build Your First Agent (6–21 min)
👉 Hands-on, guided
Your Task (Work in Small Teams)
      1. Create a new agent in your AI tool
(ChatGPT, Copilot, or similar)

      2. In the agent setup/config screen, fill in each section

         * Use the content we build together

         * If your tool doesn’t have a section (e.g., conversation starters), skip it

            3. Save your agent

            4. Test it on a real example, then tweak the instructions as needed

Slide 4 — Why This Is an Agent (21–23 min) ⏱ 
This works because it:
               * Solves the same job repeatedly

               * Uses fixed instructions

               * Produces a consistent output

               * Saves time every use

________________


Slide 5 — Prompt vs Agent (23–26 min) ⏱ 
Prompt
                  * One-off thinking

                  * Exploration

                  * Output varies

Agent
                     * Repeating workflow

                     * Defined steps

                     * Same output every time

Rule:
 If you’ll reuse it → it’s a candidate for an agent.

Slide 6 — Slido: Is This an Agent or Not? (26–30 min)
Audience quiz
Show 3–4 examples:
                        * “Summarize this paper”

                        * “Generate KOL visit briefs every month”

                        * “Brainstorm discussion questions”

                        * “Flag objections for every slide deck”

Participants vote:
                           * Prompt

                           * Agent

(Facilitator explains answers quickly.)

Slide 7 — What Is an Agent? (30–33 min) ⏱ 
An agent is an AI that:
                              * Has a job

                              * Follows reusable instructions

                              * Produces structured outputs

                              * Can use tools and memory

Slide 9 — Quick Start: The CRAFT Framework (38–43 min)
Use this for every prompt or agent
                                 * C — Context: background info

                                 * R — Role: AI persona

                                 * A — Action: what it must do

                                 * F — Format: output structure

                                 * T — Tone: style / voice
